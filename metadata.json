Emphasizes LTGP’s focus on customer retention value over acquisition costs (CAC), noting higher LTGP strengthens competitive advantage. Final step: Payback Period (PPD) follows. Key takeaway: Prioritize customer longevity to maximize LTGP."

For example, spending $100 to gain a customer who generates $50 monthly gross profit results in a 2-month payback (31 days in the text's example). The concept highlights businesses’ potential for rapid returns (e.g., 5x–20x in weeks/months vs. slow stock market gains). A lemonade stand example ($10/mo recurring revenue, 5-month customer lifespan) illustrates scalability—principles apply to all businesses, regardless of size."

After 30 days, $50 revenue (minus $10 cost) generates $40 gross profit to repay the debt.
