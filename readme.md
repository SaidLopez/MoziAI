# HormoziAI

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system inspired by Alex Hormozi's AI launch, designed to provide intelligent responses based on business and entrepreneurship knowledge.

## Overview

This project implements a sophisticated RAG system that combines the power of retrieval-based search with generative AI to deliver contextually relevant and accurate responses. The system is built to understand and respond to queries related to business strategy, entrepreneurship, and growth tactics.

## RAG System Architecture

The system utilizes:

Document Processing: Advanced text chunking and preprocessing

Vector Embeddings: Semantic search capabilities for relevant context retrieval with ChromaDB

Retrieval Engine: Efficient similarity search to find the most relevant information

Generation Layer: AI-powered response generation based on retrieved context

Context Management: Intelligent handling of conversation history and context windows

## Features

Semantic search across business and entrepreneurship content

Context-aware response generation

Efficient document retrieval and ranking

Scalable vector database integration

Real-time query processing

## Learning Opportunity

I hope this implementation serves as a valuable learning resource for those interested in:

Building RAG systems from scratch

Understanding vector embeddings and semantic search

Implementing retrieval-augmented generation

Creating domain-specific AI assistants

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different approaches, and adapt it for your own projects!
